# Single Multicolor File

This file includes everything, the top.stl and all the logo and text stls as one object. See below for how to Print this with multiple colors.

- Print it in multiple colors by using the file 'top_with_labels_multicolor_split_to_parts.stl' from the this Folder and right clicking it in the Slicer and click 'split to multiple parts' and coloring each file as you like. This has the problem/benefit depending on how you view it, that it splits the text into its individual letters, so you could color each letter the word "BMS" in a diffrent color. Might be useful for someone, but i find this a bit cumbersome, but this way you only need to download one file instead of multiple.
