# deye-esp32-bridge

This PCB and Software is used to create a board which communicates with your Deye/Sunsynk inverter and also the BMS of your battery (SeplosBMS and PaceBMS are supported for now).

# BOM
 - [PCB (designed with easyeda and produced by jlcpcb)](https://www.makeiton.de/produkt-kategorie/bauteile/)
 - [AZDelivery ESP32 Dev v4](https://amzn.to/41Sd0v4)
 - [2x RS485 Serial Converter](https://amzn.to/3L1OmBq)
 - [DC/DC Step Down Module](https://amzn.to/3oFFiur)
 - [3x RJ45 connectors](https://amzn.to/3AqmPo8)
 - [12V din rail power supply](https://amzn.to/3VNIEYH)

# Prepare RS485 Serial Converter
Make sure that your RS485 converter is terminated by about 120R. 
Measure the resistance between B- and A+. Should be something between 110-130 Ohms. 
If you cannot measure any resistance, you need to shorten the the two small pins next to the B- connector. 
On my boards it was labled with R13.

# Deye Setup
 - Goto Advanced Function and set to Slave and Modbus SN 01

# Flash ESP32
 - Adapt your wifi settings in the secrets.yaml
 - Connect your PC to the micro USB and run: ```esphome run deye-esp32-bridge.yaml```

# Wiring
 - Connect any 7-24V DC source to the screw headers (do not use CN2 PINS 7+8 from deye inverter, they only work for about 100mA). Make sure that JP2 is closed.
 - As an alternative you can connect directly to the USB of the ESP32. Make sure that JP2 is not closed. This method makes often problems with the RS485 connection.
 - Connect your inverters BMS RJ45 to the CAN IN RJ45 of the PCB.
 - If you want to connect your inverter and BMS via CAN. connect your BMS to the BMS IN RJ45 of the PCB.
 - Connect your Seplos BMS to RJ3
 - I used RJ45 cables without shield connected to the RJ45 connector

## Component Description
| Component | Function |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| JP1       | If closed, connects GND from Deye to GND of the BMS    |
| JP2       | If closed, connects the DCDC Converter to the ESP32    |
| JP4       | If closed, connects GND from Deye to GND of the PCB    |
| JP5       | If closed, connects GND from the BMS to GND of the PCB |
| U2        | Additional general purpose I/O / GND / 5V / 3V3        |
| R1        | Optional resistor, needed if connecting DS18B20 to U4  |
| RJ1       | Connects to the BMS port of Deye                       |
| RJ2       | Connects to the CAN Port of the BMS                    |
| RJ3       | Connects to the RS485 Port of the BMS                  |
